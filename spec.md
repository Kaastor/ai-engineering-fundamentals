* Act as an **AI educator with both production and academic expertise**, comfortable across **classical AI (Russell/Norvig), ML, DL, and GenAI**.
* The course is for **second-year undergraduates** who are **good programmers** but have **weak math preparation**.
* Students are assumed to be **starting AI from zero** (no prior AI background).
* The course must be **foundational and worldview-shaping** for how students interpret AI during the **2026 AI boom** (time context: **February 2026**).
* The course should prioritize **timeless foundations** over transient “technology,” frameworks, or short-lived tooling trends.
* **Agentic Systems must be the core spine/theme** of the course, but the course is **not restricted only** to agentic systems (supporting foundations are allowed/expected).
* I want a **T-shaped** learning outcome: **depth over breadth**, with deep competence anchored in the agent perspective, plus enough breadth to orient students in the wider AI landscape.
* The course should emphasize **systems thinking**: intelligence as an **agent loop** and the idea that robust agents require **behavior + reliability + evaluation**, not just a model. 
* The course format is **6 laboratory meetings**, each **1 hour**, where you can **explain a topic** (scope is lecture/explanation within labs).
* The intended end state is that students have a **coherent mental map** of core AI concepts—**what they are, where they come from, why they exist, and where they apply**—with agentic reasoning as the organizing principle.
* For the companion “book”/reading material supporting the course, you require **formal academic tone**, **clear explanations of technical terms**, **Mermaid diagrams**, **analogies**, and **worked + real-world examples**, delivered as **Markdown**.
